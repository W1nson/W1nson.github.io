I'm currently a first-year Scientific Computer and Applied Mathematics Master Student in the Applied Mathematics Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 

I have recived B.S. in Computer Science from UCSC in 2022. I have worked as undergraduate research assistant in [ERIC Lab](http://eric-lab.soe.ucsc.edu/home) under [Prof. Xin (Eric) Wang](https://eric-xw.github.io/)


I am a high-achieving student. I am a positive, confident, self-disciplined, outgoing, and helpful person. I am constantly challenging myself, and always put out my best effort. 

My research interests are Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning.
