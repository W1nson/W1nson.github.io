Hi, I‚Äôm Winson Chen. I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science advise by Prof. [Caiwen Ding](https://caiwending.github.io) at University of Minnesota, Twin Cities . My research interests lie in understanding AI Agents, Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Agents. In particular, I am fascinated by task-driven autonomous agents and their interaction with computer-use.


Previously, I was advised by Prof. [Eric Xin Wang](https://eric-xw.github.io/) at University of California, Santa Cruz, where I worked on various large language model (LLM) and natural language processing (NLP) topics, including achieving 2nd place in scientific innovation cateogry in Alexa Prize SocialBot Grand Challenge 5 with personalization questions.
